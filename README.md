# Python Implementations of the Algorithms from the Bachelor Report "Attacks Against RSA in Theory and Practice"

## By Thomas Siggaard, Emil Hasseltoft Kj√¶r Hansen, and Johan Enevoldsen

These are our implementations of the algorithms described in our bachelor report. The code is written in Python and is intended to be used for educational purposes.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `gmpy2`, `sympy`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `rsa`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install gmpy2 sympy numpy matplotlib rsa
```

## Running the Fermat Factorisation Method

To simulate the Fermat factorisation method iteration count, use the following command:

```bash
python3 fermat.py
```

## Running the Quadratic Sieve Factorisation Algorithm

To run the Quadratic Sieve factorisation algorithm, you can use the following command:

```bash
python3 qs_testing.py
```

## Running the Bleichenbacher Attack

To run the Bleichenbacher attack against a local padding oracle, with a random RSA key and message, use the following command:

```bash
python3 bleichenbacher.py
```
